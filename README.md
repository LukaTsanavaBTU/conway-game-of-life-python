# Conway's Game Of Life
A simulation of [Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in Python. It uses Matplotlib to display the simulation. It's also interactive: the "ctrl" key pauses and unpauses the simulation and by clicking the cells you can make them come alive.<br/>You can download the executable to try it yourself [here.](https://github.com/LukaTsanavaBTU/conway-game-of-life-python/releases/tag/1.0)

## What I Got To Practice During The Project
- Python
- Matplotlib and Numpy
- Algorithms
